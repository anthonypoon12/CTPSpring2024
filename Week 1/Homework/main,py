text = """Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry,
popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.
Swift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer.
She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006).
Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame.
Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song,
"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs"Shake It Off",
"Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
